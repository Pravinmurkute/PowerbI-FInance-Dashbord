## Problem Statement

"This dashboard provides financial institutions with comprehensive insights into their performance and customer satisfaction metrics. By analyzing various indicators, such as customer ratings and feedback, financial institutions can gain a deeper understanding of client satisfaction levels and areas for improvement.

The dashboard offers visibility into key performance metrics, including average response times, transaction processing times, and customer wait times. This enables financial institutions to identify bottlenecks in their processes and streamline operations for enhanced efficiency.

With a clear overview of customer satisfaction and operational performance, financial institutions can prioritize initiatives to improve service quality and reduce wait times. By addressing customer concerns and optimizing operational processes, institutions can strive to enhance overall satisfaction levels and strengthen customer loyalty.
